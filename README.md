Multi client chat application built using socket programming-python
client.py and server.py are mini version of chatclient.py and chatserver.py.

To run the application first run chatserver.py and then multiple times run chatclient.py to create multiple clients.

Enter at one of the client windows, for it to be reflected on the server winow and also window of other clients.
This way a client can send message to all other clients.
